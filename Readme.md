# Hatter
It's like flutter but instead of dart, haskell!

Write native mobile apps in Haskell.
This works similar to react native where we have
thight bindings on the existing UI frameworks
provided android and IOS.

This project cross-compiles a Haskell library to Android (APK) and iOS (static library / IPA),
with a thin platform-native UI layer (Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS).
The library fully controls the UI.
This is different from say Simplex chat where they call into the library to do Haskell from dirty java/swift code.
This library writes basically all swift/java code you'll ever need for you,
and allows you to do sweet haskell.

Haskell is in fact fantastic for UI.
Having strong type safety around callbacks and widget's 
makes it a lot easier to write them.
