{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
-- | Reproducer for issue #168: switching between two ScrollViews
-- via state causes the diff algorithm to "mix" their content.
--
-- The two screens use DIFFERENT widget types at the same child
-- positions (Text vs Button) so that the diff engine calls
-- replaceNode (destroy old + create new) instead of in-place update.
-- This triggers the bug: android_destroy_node frees the JNI ref
-- but doesn't remove the native View from its parent, so orphaned
-- views linger in the ScrollView after switching.
